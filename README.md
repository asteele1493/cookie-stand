# Salmon Cookies

## Code Fellows 201 lab

- Updated 07/27/22: This is my salmon cookies lab for Code Fellows course 201. The problem domain is described below, as well as general (initial) ideas for how I plan on organizing my project.

### Problem domain

- Create separate JS object literals for each shop location.
- Each location will be responsible for generating sales data and providing output on an html document.
- You should be able to perform the following in your JS file
  1. Store the min/max hourly customers, and the average cookies per customer, in object properties.
  2. Use a method of that object to generate a random number of customers per hour. Objects/Math/random
  3. Calculate and store the simulated amounts of cookies purchased for each hour at each location using average cookies purchased and the random number of customers generated.
  4. Store the results for each location in a separate arrayâ€¦ perhaps as a property of the object representing that location.
  5. Display the values of each array as unordered lists in the browser.
  6. Calculating the sum of these hourly totals; your output for each location should look like this:
  7. Display the lists on sales.html. We will be adding features to this application and working with its layout in the upcoming labs.
